                    <p>
                        In software development process, there's always a dilemma for both developers and clients between choosing 
                        technologies, tools, frameworks or platforms from endless numbers of providers available in the market today. 
                        Among these, the most common concern we have before creating a website is to choose between Website Builder and 
                        Website Coding.<br>
                        In this blog post, I'll explain everything in detail and simple manner so that it become very easy for you to choose 
                        the one that exactly matches your needs. But before knowing which website building approach is better for you, 
                        let's first know what does these terms actually mean.

                                <p>
                                    <b>Website Coding-</b> In this approach, a website is created using manual coding by a professional 
                                    Web Developer. Here, a developer spends much time on understanding the ideas, design and 
                                    functionalities from the client and then creates a custom website that helps to achieve great 
                                    business value for its client.<br>
                                    All the major software companies such as 
                                    <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, 
                                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, 
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> 
                                    have built their websites using this approach.
                                </p>

                                            <u>Customization:</u> The major advantage of using manual coding is its customization capability. There's
                                            endless possibility to personalized the webpages that creates an unmatch brand for your company.<br>
                                            Imagine the Google home page, by looking at anywhere within the page we can identify its brand.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>
                                            <u>Functionalities:</u> The next important factor is integrating different functions to the website. With
                                            manual coding we can integrate any tools such as powerful sales and marketing tools.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            <u>Performances:</u> We can optimize the website using various techniques to run smoothly in all types 
                                            of devices and platforms.<br>
                                            Nowadays, every website builder companies working relentlessly to improve its performances; 
                                            however it's still behind the manual coding.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>
                                            <u>Scalability:</u> Another factor is ability to scale-up the website using different platforms. We can host
                                            our website to any server such as shared, dedicated or cloud as we wish.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        <p>
                                            <u>Cost:</u> Website build through coding by a Web Developer or a software house cost relatively higher 
                                            as compared to using website builder since it takes more time and experience to build a great website.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>
                                            <u>Time:</u> Another important factor to consider is time, it may takes few weeks to months to build a 
                                            professional full-fledged website.

                                           <u>Usability:</u> Coding as we all know is a tough job, so it's important for a client to hire a 
                                            well-experience developer to create their website as there're multiple dimensions one need to 
                                            consider while creating a website.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>
                                            <u>Support:</u> It is difficult for any new developer you hire to update features or make any corrections 
                                            on a website created by other developer as everyone follows different approach and style of
                                            development.
                                        </p>

                                    <b>Website Builder-</b> It is basically a content management tool that allows us to create a website without
                                    writing or editing the underlying code. It provides all the basic requirements to run the website in a 
                                    single place such as getting a domain name, hosting webpages and add essential security features like a SSL.<br>
                                    There're number of website builders you can see in the market today and almost all of them provide both free and 
                                    premium plan of their products. I have listed few of them below:<br>

                                            <u>Cost:</u> It is the primary factor on choosing website builder over manual coding. It cost 
                                            significantly less to create a website using builder as you just have to pay the subscription plan
                                            on yearly basis and then either create the website yourself or else hire a Freelancer with a very
                                            nominal fees.

                                            <u>Time:</u> It is another great advantage, we can create webpages within a couple of hours or days
                                            based on the complexity of the website.

                                            <u>Usability:</u> It is a very easy to use tool having drag-and-drop interface, anyone can modify the 
                                            webpages with the required admin access.

                                            <u>Support:</u> You'll get better technical support and documentation from the website builder 
                                            companies to manage your website with ease.

                                            <u>Customization:</u> We cannot completely customize the design, designs are based on standard layout and 
                                            may resemble to other websites made using same builder.

                                    <u>Business Needs:</u> Is your website will provide some source of information or just sell simple products/services?<br>
                                    If yes, go for website builder.<br>
                                    If no i.e. your website might rely on external software integrations to perform critical functions then 
                                    choose manual coding.

                                    If yes, choose manual coding.<br>
                                    If no then website builder is perfect for you.

                                    If no i.e. you have time to complete it within few weeks or months then manual coding can be an option

                        A webpage is a document on the World Wide Web. Webpage is delivered by a web server to the user and 
                        displayed in a web browser. A website consists of many webpages linked together.
                        We'll be creating a portfolio website for a Graphic Designer having three webpages-
                    </p>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>

                        Basically, there're three stages in development of a webpage- defining the structure or elements of the webpage, 
                        design each element withtin the page and adding functionality to the webpage. 
                        For our project we'll be going to create the webpages in two stages-

                                        In your computer Desktop, create a folder and name it as "Demo-Website".
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="resources/images/demo-website.png" style="width:100%">

                                        File -> Open Folder -> Browse to the "Demo-Website" folder -> Click on Select Folder
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="resources/images/demo-website-folder.jpg" style="width:100%">

                                        Click on New File in the Explorer panel and name the file as "index.html" then press Enter.<br>
                                        This file will contain all the contents of the Home page. Similarly, add two more files "projects.html" 
                                        and "contact.html".
                                    </p>

                                        In the "index.html" file, type exclamation mark "!" and press Enter. This will add the basic HTML
                                        elements into the file. Rename the title to "Demo Portfolio".
                                    </p>

                                        Add header "Graphic Designer" to the webpage using h1 tag within the body tag.<br>
                                        There are six different heading tags h1 to h6 used to give different importance to texts.<br>
                                        Now, we'll define the structure for Navigation Bar inside the body tag. It is the UI element on a 
                                        webpage that includes links for the other sections of the website.<br>

                                        You might notice that the header and navigation bar that we have added doesn't look visually appealing,
                                        so we have to design it using CSS or Cascading Style Sheets to make the page user friendly. There're three 
                                        types of CSS styling- inline, internal and external. We're going to use external CSS for our project.<br>
                                        At first, create a New File from Explorer panel and name it as "style.css".<br>
                                        Secondly, we need to link this external file to our "index.html" file. We'll use link tag inside head 
                                        tag to define the rel - relationship between document linked and html file, href - relative reference 
                                        and type - internet media type.<br>
                                        <b>link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css"</b><br>
                                        Lastly, add design properties for body, h1, navbar class and anchor links in the "style.css".
                                    </p>
                                    <ul type="square">

                                                image name in the CSS file.

                                        Our navigation bar is almost comeplete, and you might be seeing the desired output in your browser. 
                                        But one important thing to consider is that our webpage is not yet responsive i.e. if we try to open
                                        this page in a device with smaller screen size, then the contents will look messed up. You can verify 
                                        this in the above codepen viewer.<br>
                                        To fix this, we'll use CSS @media queries, it instructs browser how to display contents of a website depending 
                                        upon the screen size. In our case, for devices with screen-width below 855px, we want the contents of nav bar to 
                                        align vertically.
                                    </p>

                                        You may think that designing using external CSS is quite time consuming, we have to manually define the structure
                                        and add design properties to each elements separately, also add media queries to make them responsive. For these 
                                        disadvantages, we'll be using Bootstrap framework to add CSS properties to all our HTML elements going forward.<br>
                                        Bootstrap makes web styling much easier as compared to traditional CSS styling. Using Bootstrap we can add multiple 
                                        design classes to the same html element, we can add icons to the elements, all Bootstrap classes are responsive so we 
                                        need not write media queries for each elements.<br>
                                        Let's creater a footer using Bootstrap. Footer element in a webpage typically contains
                                        authorship information, contact information, sitemap, back to top links, etc.<br>
                                        Firstly, to use Bootstrap CSS class in our webpage, link it using the link tag inside the head element. Make sure to add
                                        this line before our externar CSS "style.css", since we want our custom changes to override the Bootstrap default class styling.<br>
                                        <b>
                                            link<br> href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"<br> rel="stylesheet"<br>
                                            integrity="sha384-GLhlTQ8iRABdZLl6O3oVMWSktQOp6b7In1Zl3/Jr59b6EGGoI1aFkw7cmDA6j6gD"<br> crossorigin="anonymous"
                                        </b><br>
                                        Secondly, we'll add Bootstrap icons link to use icons in our footer.<br>
                                        <b>link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.10.3/font/bootstrap-icons.css"</b><br>
                                        Lastly, we'll add the footer elements with the required Bootstrap classes for desiging the elements.<br>
                                        To learn more about each of the below classes refer to the official documentation from 
                                        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.

                                        Now, we will proceed to create the main contents of the webpage inside main tag. 
                                        The main tag specifies the main content of a document.<br> 
                                        We'll create three sections using div tag. Div or Division is the most useful tag used to create layouts 
                                        or sections and group elements within html document.<br>
                                        Firstly, we'll create the about section using Bootstrap container class and design it as Jumbotron.
                                        Jumbotron is a big box used to give extra attention to contents within a webpage.<br>
                                        Secondly, we'll add the skills and experience section using grid system. We can create layouts to 
                                        divide the webpage into rows and columns using Bootstrap grid system.<br>
                                        Finally, we'll create the services section to list down all the services provided by the Graphic 
                                        Designer using container class.<br>
                                        Please ensure to add this block of code above the footer section.

                                        With this our Home page is completed. Now, we'll define the Projects page. Go to "projects.html" 
                                        file from the Explorer panel in the left, type exclamation mark "!" and press Enter. This will add the basic HTML

                                        To keep the design consistent across all the webpages, make sure to add the same CSS file links from
                                        "index.html" inside the head element.<br>

                                        Now, we'll create the main contents for this page. Here, we'll list all the projects of the Graphic 
                                        Designer in carousel style. The Carousel plugin in Bootstrap is used for cycling through elements, like a slideshow.<br>
                                        Firstly, we'll define a div element with carousel-indicators class and button tags to identify the viewed project.<br>
                                        Secondly, we'll list all the projects using carousel-item class.<br>
                                        Finally, we'll add two buttons to navigate through the projects using carousel-control classes.

                                        After adding the above block of code, you might notice that you're unable to navigate through the slides. This is 
                                        because we haven't added the functionalities to the elements yet. We'll add it and discuss further on the functionalities 
                                        of webpage in the next stage.<br>
                                        Now, let's create the last webpage i.e. the contact form to this project. Open the "contact.html" file from the Explorer panel, 
                                        type exclamation mark "!" and press Enter to add basic HTML elements into the file. Rename the title to "Contact".<br>

                                        Now, we'll create the contact form using form element inside the main tag.<br>
                                        Firstly, we'll define three input fields using input tag and form-control Bootstrap class to get the 
                                        username, email id and message. We have used required tag to inform user that name and email must be filled.<br>
                                        Then, we define the submit button to post the form. In form action, we have declared the action to redirect to mail.php file 
                                        and method type is post. Action attribute is used to define the webpage where the form data will be send.

                                        With this the static part of our website is completed. You must be wondering how to receive mails using the form
                                        that we have just created. For this purpose we have to add mail functionality using PHP script. We'll be discussing 
                                        further on PHP functionalities in the coming stage.
                                    </p>

                                        We'll be using JavaScript and PHP to add functionalities to our website. JavaScript is used to make 
                                        webpage dynamic and helps in adding effects and animation.<br>
                                        Now, we're going to add the navigation functionality to the carousel that we have defined in the "projects.html".
                                        We'll be using pre-defined Bootstrap JavaScript components data-bs-target and data-bs-slide to control the elements. 
                                        To use them, we need to add the JavaScript filename in the src attribute of script tag.<br>
                                        <b>script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"</b><br>
                                        Please make sure to add this script just before the body closing tag to minimize the loading time required by browser to 
                                        execute the JavaScript file.<br>
                                        We can create any custom functions using JavaScript in a file (e.g.- myscript.js) and attached to a webpage.

                                        PHP is a server side scripting language for web development which is used to perform various operations.<br>
                                        Please make a note that we're using basic pre-defined function in PHP to enable the mail functionality. Howevever, it's 
                                        always recommended to use external PHP mailing package such as PHPMailer for better security and features.<br>
                                        Create a new file using the Explorere panel in the left and name it as mail.php. We'll first enable the error reporting 
                                        functions ini_set() and error_reporting() so that we get notification if the PHP script fails to execute.<br>
                                        Then, we declare and define the variables $to, $name, $email and $message to store the values from contact form and pass it 
                                        to the mail() function.<br>

                                        To execute the mail function, we need to store the php file in a server which allows Sendmail service configuration. Sendmail is a 
                                        server application that gives businesses a way to send email using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).<br>

                                Browse the location where you want to store your project files and click Create File.

                                To launch a webpage, we need to atleast define the basic HTML elements such as- DOCTYPE, 
                                html lang, head, title and body. You can either manually type them or use VS Code Emmet for auto-filling.<br>
                                To use Emmet, just type exclamation symblol "!" and press Enter, it'll fill the minimum HTML 
                                elements needed to make webpage using default values.

                                Change the title to "My First Webpage" and add a paragrapgh inside body tag using p tag
                                "Hello World, Welcome to my Website.". Save the file by pressing ctrl+s.
                            </p>

                                Now, to launch this webpage in browser we need this file in a server. Luckily, in VS Code we 
                                have a extension called as Live Server that helps to launch a development local Server with live 
                                reload feature for static & dynamic pages.<br>
                                To enable this extension, click on Extensions icon present in the left bar and search for "Live Server".

                                Open the folder where you have saved the project file.<br>
                                Now, you can directly run the webpage in browser by simply clicking on Go Live button in the below status bar.

                        The time requirement for a website development depends on multiple factors. Basically there're two approaches to build 
                        a website- using Website Builder and by manual coding. To give you a better idea, I have provided the time estimation 
                        for building a website based on following criteria.<br>

                    <p>
                        You must understand this that there can't be a single answer to this question because every client have their unique 
                        requirements for their website. Two similar websites might have the same application i.e. to sell stationery items- one of them 
                        just need a single webpage where all the products are listed and from here customers can buy them directly whereas the 
                        other application owner needs more functionalities such as keeping track of customers, suggesting books by analyzing their interests,
                        sending updates for new products, etc. So, it's always recommended having a phone chat to get an actual quote for your website 
                        development project.<br>
                        However, I prefer to charge based on the time required to complete a website rather than on how complex functionalities it can have. You
                        can refer to my above answer to understand on time requirement for website development.
